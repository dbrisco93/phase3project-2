Good For The Sole

After finishing Flatiron School, I went back to revisit some of my old projects. This project was originally done in Mod 3 with HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend and Rails backend. Current changes include:

- Styling changes using fullpage.js and custom CSS
- Refactoring Javascript code

Original project: https://github.com/sannydo/phase3project
